I am **Han Xu**, a forest ecologist 

# Research focus

- Tree size inequality (Gini, Lorenz asymmetry) and forest dynamics
- Structural diversity as a driver of productivity and temporal stability
- Cross-site synthesis across long-term forest dynamics plots
- Spatially explicit analyses of forest structure and ecosystem services

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Methods & toolkits</strong></summary>

- Inequality metrics and structural diversity indices
- Multi-scale quadrat-based analyses (20×20 m to hectare scale)
- Reproducible workflows in **R / Python**
- Spatial modeling, interpolation, and mapping

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Selected outputs</strong></summary>

- Tree size inequality analysis pipelines (link to be added)
- Forest stability and biodiversity–structure mechanisms (link to be added)
- Nature-based solutions and carbon stock change mapping (link to be added)

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Collaboration</strong></summary>

I welcome collaborations on multi-census forest synthesis, forest stability mechanisms, and structure–function relationships, particularly projects requiring harmonized pipelines and cross-site comparability.
