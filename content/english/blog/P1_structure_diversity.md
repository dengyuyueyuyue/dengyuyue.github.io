In species-rich natural tropical forests, higher structural diversity may
**destabilize** long-term function by amplifying competitive asymmetry among adult trees.

## Why this page exists

Most forest ecologists grew up with a comforting idea: **more biodiversity stabilizes ecosystem functioning**.
But in *natural* tropical forests—where species richness is already extreme—this relationship may not behave the way we assume.

This page introduces an ongoing research direction I am building with long-term Forest Dynamics Plot (FDP) data:**structural diversity may be a more reliable predictor of long-term stability than species richness—and it may even act as a “bad guy.”**

> **Callout | Quick take**
> I am inviting collaborators from ForestGEO and other FDP networks to test whether *structural diversity* (size/space heterogeneity) can **reduce** long-term stability in mature, species-rich tropical forests, and to map when/where that happens.

## The core question

We focus on **long-term temporal stability** of forest productivity (or biomass-related proxies), commonly quantified as:

- **Stability (S)** = mean productivity / temporal standard deviation (μ / σ)

In words: *a forest is “stable” when it maintains high function with low inter-census variability.*

### Two candidate predictors

- **Species richness (SR)**Captures how many species are present; often linked to stability via **asynchrony** (insurance effects).
- **Structural diversity (SD)**
  Captures size and form variation among individuals (e.g., stem size inequality, canopy layering); a more proximate representation of **realized niche occupancy**.

## Why structural diversity could be the “bad guy” in natural tropical forests

In mature tropical forests, **structure is not just heterogeneity—it is competition embodied**.

- Strong asymmetric competition for light
- Large size inequality among adult trees
- Demographic stochasticity and neighborhood crowding
- Potential niche overlap despite high SR

These processes can generate a counterintuitive outcome:

> **Callout | Hypothesis**
> In species-rich natural tropical forests, higher structural diversity (especially adult-tree size inequality) may **destabilize** long-term function by amplifying competitive asymmetry and increasing inter-census volatility.

## What is missing in the literature

Evidence for biodiversity–stability (and structural diversity–stability) relationships in forests is often derived from:

- temperate forests with lower SR
- sapling layers (where size variation is narrow)
- experimental plantations with few species

What we still lack are tests that are simultaneously:

1. **Species-rich** (natural tropical/subtropical forests)
2. **Adult-tree dominated** (where size inequality is pronounced)
3. **Long-term** (multiple censuses, not short snapshots)
4. **Cross-site comparable** (replication across plots)

> **Callout | Why FDP plots matter**
> Long-term FDP censuses are one of the few data infrastructures that can directly test these questions with the necessary temporal depth and demographic detail.

## What I am building

This project aims to develop a **cross-site, census-based framework** to evaluate:

- whether SD outperforms SR in predicting long-term stability
- whether SD effects are **directionally negative** in mature tropical forests
- whether effects operate via:
  - species asynchrony
  - population-level stability
  - direct structural mechanisms

### What counts as “structural diversity” here?

Depending on what a site can provide, SD can include (examples):

- size inequality metrics (e.g., Gini of DBH / basal area contribution)
- distributional shape metrics (e.g., Lorenz-based asymmetry)
- vertical and horizontal structure proxies (when available)

<summary><strong>Click to expand: What I typically need from a plot (minimal data request)</strong></summary>

- Standard FDP tree census table(s), including:

  - tree ID
  - species code
  - DBH (and measurement dates/census ID)
  - status (alive/dead) and recruitment information if available
  - spatial coordinates (optional but strongly preferred for spatial analyses)
- At least **3 censuses** preferred (more is better)
- Site metadata: plot area, census years, basic climate descriptors if available

## What collaborators get

I want this to be a **low-friction, high-credit** collaboration model.

- Co-authorship opportunities (default for meaningful data contributions)
- Site PI involvement welcomed in framing + interpretation
- Transparent pipeline: reproducible scripts, documented outputs
- Option to include site-specific questions (e.g., drought years, disturbance history)

> **Callout | Collaboration modes**
> (1) Data contribution + co-authorship
> (2) Joint analysis with your team
> (3) Methods transfer: I help you run the pipeline locally if data governance requires

## Data governance & credit

I fully respect plot-level governance.

- No redistribution of raw plot data
- Analyses are reproducible and shareable
- Site PI approval and authorship policies will be followed
- Outputs can be returned in formats useful for your site reporting

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to expand: A simple authorship statement (draft)</strong></summary>

Authorship will follow standard ecological norms and site governance policies.
Plots providing data that are central to cross-site inference will be offered co-authorship.
Site PIs are encouraged to co-develop interpretations and contribute context on disturbance history, measurement protocols, and site-specific mechanisms.

</details>

## Current status

- Conceptual framework: ready
- Pipeline: under active development and harmonization across censuses
- Target outputs:
  - a cross-site synthesis paper
  - a methods note / open workflow (where permitted)
  - optional plot-specific vignettes

## Interested in joining?

If you manage or work with a Forest Dynamics Plot and are interested in testing how **structural diversity shapes long-term stability**, I would be very happy to connect.
