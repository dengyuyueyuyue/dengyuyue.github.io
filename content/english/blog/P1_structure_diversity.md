## The traditional view on biodiversity and temporal stability

Most forest ecologists grew up with a reassuring idea: **more biodiversity stabilizes ecosystem functioning** (maintaining [temporal stability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_stability) over time).

This view is deeply rooted in decades of evidence—but that evidence comes largely from  **grasslands, boreal forests, and seedling-dominated systems** , ecosystems that share one key feature:  **relatively low species richness** , often on the order of  *a few to a few dozen species per hectare* .

But is this pattern truly general?

> In  *natural tropical and subtropical forests* —where species richness is already extraordinarily high—does biodiversity still stabilize ecosystem functioning in the same way we assume? Or does the relationship begin to behave differently once diversity reaches extreme levels?

**This is a question worth revisiting.**

## A defining feature of mature tropical and subtropical forests: structural diversity

Beyond species richness, mature tropical and subtropical forests are characterized by another striking property:  **pronounced structural diversity** .

1. **Strong vertical structure**

Tropical forests host towering emergent trees alongside a complex and persistent understory. This creates vertical structural diversity, which captures variation in the  **size and form of plant organs** , such as tree stems and crowns, across individuals. In many cases, this structural variation far exceeds what is observed in temperate or boreal systems.

2. **Heterogeneous horizontal arrangement**

At the same time, tropical forests are rarely spatially uniform. Some patches are densely packed, while others are relatively open. We refer to this spatial heterogeneity as  **horizontal structural diversity** . Dense neighborhoods may experience weaker individual-level competition, whereas open areas can impose stronger competitive pressures.
Over long time scales, these contrasting spatial configurations may profoundly shape  **community dynamics and temporal stability** —yet their role remains surprisingly underexplored.

{{< callout type="info" title="Quick take" >}}
 We are inviting collaborators from ForestGEO and other FDP networks to test whether
*structural diversity* (size and spatial heterogeneity) can **reduce long-term stability**
in mature, species-rich tropical forests, and to map when and where that happens.

## Why structural diversity could be the “bad guy” in forest ecosystems?

Structural diversity is often praised for creating more ecological niches, **but not just heterogeneity—it is competition embodied** .

In species-rich forests, extreme structural complexity can introduce new sources of instability:

* **Vertical structure amplifies asymmetric competition**

  Large size differences intensify unequal access to light, water, and nutrients. A small number of dominant trees monopolize resources, while many others remain persistently suppressed.
* **Horizontal structure creates uneven resource allocation**

  Highly clustered or overly dispersed spatial patterns can skew how energy and resources are distributed across space, weakening the community’s ability to buffer fluctuations over time.
* **Productivity is growth-dominated and therefore fragile**

  In mature forests, most productivity comes from the growth of existing large trees rather than from recruitment. When these large trees are lost during extreme events (e.g., typhoons or severe storms), productivity can drop abruptly—and recruitment rarely compensates for this loss in the short term.

These mechanisms point toward a **counterintuitive possibility**:

{{< callout type="tip" title=" " >}}

In species-rich natural tropical forests, higher structural diversity—especially adult-tree size inequality—may **destabilize** long-term ecosystem functioning by amplifying competitive asymmetry and increasing temporal volatility.

## The core question

> **Is the effect of species richness (SR) on ecosystem stability universally positive?**
>
> We test whether SR consistently enhances temporal stability across  **tropical, subtropical, temperate, and boreal forests** , or whether its role changes in species-rich systems.
>
> **What is the role of structural diversity (SD) in forest ecosystems?**
>
> Is structural diversity a stabilizing force—or can it act as a “bad guy” that **destabilizes** long-term temporal stability?
>
> **Through which mechanisms do SR and SD regulate temporal stability at the global scale mature forest?**
>
> Do they act primarily via  **species asynchrony** ,  **population-level stability** , or through more **direct structural controls** on forest dynamics?

# Summary:

### 1. What is missing in the literature

Evidence for biodiversity–stability (and structural diversity–stability) relationships in forests is often derived from:

- temperate forests with relatively low species richness
- sapling layers, where size variation is narrow
- experimental plantations with only a few species

What we still lack are tests that are simultaneously:

1. **Species-rich** (natural tropical or subtropical forests)
2. **Adult-tree dominated** (where size inequality is pronounced)
3. **Long-term** (multiple censuses, not short snapshots)
4. **Cross-site comparable** (replication across plots)

{{< callout type="note" title="Why FDP plots matter" >}}
Long-term FDP censuses are one of the few data infrastructures that can directly
test these questions with the necessary temporal depth and demographic detail.

### 2. What we are building

Science 2024, this project aims to develop a **cross-site, census-based analytical framework** to evaluate:

- whether structural diversity outperforms species richness in predicting long-term stability
- whether structural diversity effects are **directionally negative** in mature tropical forests
- whether these effects operate via:
  - species asynchrony
  - population-level stability
  - or direct structural mechanisms

### 3. What we typically need from a plot (minimal data request)e?

We prefer **BCI-style FDP tree census data** (tree-level tables), and will provide standardized templates for data formatting, primarily include:

- - tree ID
  - species code
  - DBH (with census year or measurement date,unit of cm or mm)
  - status (alive/dead) and recruitment information, if available
  - spatial coordinates (optional but strongly preferred for spatial analyses)
- At least **three censuses** preferred (more is better)
- Site metadata: plot area, census years, and basic climate descriptors if available

### 4. What collaborators get

I aim to keep this a **low-friction, high-credit** collaboration model.

- Co-authorship opportunities (default for meaningful data contributions)
- Site PI involvement welcomed in framing and interpretation
- Transparent, reproducible pipelines with documented outputs

{{< callout type="success" title="Collaboration modes" >}}

1. **Data contribution + co-authorship**
2. **Joint analysis with your team**
3. **Methods transfer** – We help you run the pipeline locally if data governance requires

{{< callout type="warning" title="One-sentence pitch (copy & paste)" >}}
I am building a cross-site FDP analysis to test whether structural diversity is a
stronger—and potentially negative—predictor of long-term stability than species
richness in mature, species-rich tropical forests.
